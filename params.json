In this, incoming msgs do NOT scroll. Instead, last msg overwrites prev on a per/topic basis. Think: temp/outdoors and webserv/status where I see last value without panel scrolling moving: just values on topics change.\r\n* Panel showing low-level communication with broker\r\n* Panels can be frozen (halts all display activity) for, say, taking screenshots\r\n\r\n# Net features in 1.2\r\n* Pinch to size SUBs display\r\n* Rotate to size Messages display\r\n\r\n# Future enhancements\r\n* View filters\r\n* View traps\r\n* automatically repeating PUBs\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
